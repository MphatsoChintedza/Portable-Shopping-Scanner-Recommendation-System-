# Portable-Shopping-Scanner-Recommendation-System-
Shoppers often find it enjoyable to satisfy their shopping needs as they can spend time in shops and malls in good conditions, and this includes not only the quality of the products they buy, but also the shopping conditions including the facilities provided by the shopping centres either they are related to checking, unloading and reloading, scanning and payment proceedings. Accordingly, the idea of this project concerns the introduction of an innovative shopping technological system called a portable scanner, that will give customers a good product recommendation based on their previous purchase, it will also help them to know the prices, and generate the total amount of their shopping list. The system will save customers from scratching their head to think what to purchase for the day as well as  from unloading and reload their shopped items at the checkpoints and it will also save a lot of work and time  for the employees as they are always asked by customers on item suggestions and traditionally checking out products to recommend to the customers.
